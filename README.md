# DBN Compiler
C/C++ implementation of DBN ([Design By Numbers](http://dbn.media.mit.edu/)) Compiler.

Some features are still in progress.

## Overview
The DBN compiler translates DBN source into [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) source file. The resulting [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) source files can then be loaded and executed on any web browser.

## Compiler command line
`$ dbn compile sample.dbn compiled.svg`
